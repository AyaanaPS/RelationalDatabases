â€” [Problem 2]

customerAccount(_username_, email, webURL, openTime, subPrice, accountType)
	*webURL is a candidate key

servers(_hostname_, OSType, maxSites, serverType)

packages(_name_, _version_, description, price)

sharedServer(_hostname_)
	*hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname

dedicatedServer(_hostname_)
	*hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname

-Since each basic account must be associated with exactly one shared server, it makes
-sense to combine the basicAccount entity set and the basicHosted relationship set.

basicAccount(_username_, hostname)
	*username is a foreign key to customerAccount.username
	*hostname is a foreign key to sharedServer.hostname

-Similarly, since each preferred account must be associated with exactly one dedicated
-server, it makes sense to combine the preferredAccount entity set and the preferredHosted
-relationship set.

preferredAccount(_username_, hostname)
	*username is a foreign key to customerAccount.username
	*hostname is a foreign key to dedicatedServer.hostname)

uses(_username_, _name_, _version_)
	*username is a foreign key to customerAccount.username
	*name is a foreign key to packages.name
	*version is a foreign key to packages.version

installed(_hostname_, _name_, _version_)
	*hostname is a foreign key to servers.hostname
	*name is a foreign key to packages.name
	*version is a foreign key to packages.version
